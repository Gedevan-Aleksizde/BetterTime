# BetterTime
Shemiroth, the original author of Better Time, is no longer maintaining the mod. Because it modifies an XML prefab which only works on Bannerlord 1.5.8 and older, starting with 1.5.9 the extra time speed button no longer appears as this version uses new autogenerated prefabs.

With their permission, I have taken over the mod and updated it to work on Bannerlord 1.5.9.

This mod is compatible with Kaoses Tweaks and it has to be after Kaoses Tweaks in the load order.

Now with new MCM settings, the default speed options are 1x, 2x, and 3x the base speed multiplier (4x). So the actual speed multipliers are 4x, 8x and 12x. This is to ensure compatibility with Kaoses Tweaks as the speed options in Better Time will be a multiple of the speed setting in Kaoses Tweaks.

If you encounter a crash, always provide the crash report from Better Exception Windowï»¿. It makes it much easier for me to troubleshoot it.

This mod requires:
- UIExtenderEx
- MCM

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
